# Inform 6 extension for VS Code

This extension adds support for Inform 6 in VS Code.

## Features

For the moment, this extension only adds syntax colouring to Inform 6 source (`.inf` and `.h` file extensions) and to Inform 6 templates (`.i6t` file extension, mainly used by Inform 7 when including Inform 6 within the source).

Additionnaly, strings used as arguments in Vorple's `VorpleExecuteJavaScriptCommand` and `BuildCommand` routines have JavaScript syntax highlighting.

## Known Issues

See the file `TODO.md` in the repository.
