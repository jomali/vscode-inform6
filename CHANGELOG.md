# Change Log

## 0.1.1

### Changed

- Improved JavaScript highlighting: escape sequences are now highlighted in strings and function are now in a different colour than variables.
- Inform 7 inclusions in Inform 6 templates (with `(+` an `+)`) are now not coloured, since that is specific to Inform 7 included in Inform 6 which is itself included in Inform 7, and is not used in `i6t` files.
- Improved highlighting of special variables in Inform 6 templates (delimited with `{` and `}`): some characters inside them are now forbidden, such as `"`.

## 0.1.0

- Initial release
